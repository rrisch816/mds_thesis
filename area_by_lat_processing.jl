## Splitting craters by unit and lattitude band

abl = importdataset("area_by_lat.csv", importas=:Tuple)
crat = importdataset("craters.csv", importas=:Tuple)

# Need string processing for lat_band column in area_by_lat.csv

# assign craters band numbers? dictionary mapping? -17:-34 = 2 (ex)
for i in length(crat)
    if LAT >=

l1 = 0 .< crat.LAT .< 17

tU = crat.Unit .== "AHi"

t .& tU
 # for loops


 # if count t is less than 1000, break or continue (as opposed to trying to fit the isochron model)
